The CSVs here are exported from a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169pTK91ZydbUZVJYTIvs3jX6sotllIddYB9MY55AJNc/edit#gid=754910469),
but once this PR has buy-in, this repo will be the single source of truth, and that spreadsheet will be deleted, to avoid confusion.
(But while we're reviewing this PR, feel free to edit and re-export from there.)

With these samples, I am only trying to pin down the high-level structure of the CSVs:
What will the column names be? What IDs need to be supplied? How are entities across the provenance chain connected?

The actual metadata columns will be coming soon, but we don't need to block on that.
