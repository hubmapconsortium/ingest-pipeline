# HuBMAP Ingest Pipeline

## About

This repository implements the internals of the HuBMAP data repository
processing pipeline. This code is independent of the UI but works in
response to requests from the data-ingest UI backend.

The specifics of metadata transformations are in
[hubmap-sample-metadata](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hubmap-sample-metadata/),
and this repo will import python modules defined there.
